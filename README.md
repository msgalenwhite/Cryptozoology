# Cryptozoology

This is a group project for Launch Academy.  It began as an assignment to create a ratings site with a 2 week deadline.  What it became was: [Cryptozoology!](https://cryptozoology.herokuapp.com/)

You can use this site to see cryptids name, description, a picture, and location. For each cryptid a registered user can submit a sighting of the cryptid with the place they saw it, a description of the event, an optional photo of the sighting and rate how confident they are of their sighting. The user can also upvote or downvote each sighting that has been submitted once. The user can edit their own sightings or delete them. You can browse cryptids by category(type), or Region(location). Our front page shows the 5 most recent sightings and you can click the name of the cryptid to jump to it.

A user can also submit a new cryptid with a name, photo, description, and tag a region and category.

Admins can delete/edit any cryptid or sighting. Additionally they can delete any user.

Any user can use the search bar on the top to search the name of a cryptid
